        <p>I shut down my laptop, washed my face and wiped out it by my green towel then turned down the lights and beds and layed down to sleep at midnight. It was mild raining and windy outside which I could feel by its constant tipping sound coming through my window which is just next to my bed and is mostly remains open. I was pleased by the way the cold breeze touching my hair, cheeks, and neck, I was half inside my blanket. I felt very relax and calm and I wanted to sleep without any disturbance. But the nature was against my desire to sleep early. The turr turr, chee chee, tip tap sounds of birds, squirrels, lizards from my backporch were directly coming through my window. Though I love these guys 'cause they are my neighbour and some of them even live with me in my room. But I was not in the mood to join their party. I just wanted to sleep. I could just close the window but I prefer to keep it open mostly the fresh and sweet air come through it. So I was wondering is there a better way. I was just wondering about this and as I kept increasing my focus on my thoughts I stopped hearing any disturbance due to my physical absence in my room and gradualy I started to dream about some of my bittersweet desires and I slept in no time.</p>

           In the hot summer of May in a small village in Bihar, an engineering student with good looks and humor was to attend a marriage fuction with his parents at his cousins' home.The guy has not been lived much there so he was like a guest to the locals and has no friends to talk to, except his smartphone. It was noon and the guy was playing game in his phone and drinking cold drink among his parents, uncle and aunt. Everyone was gossiping with each other but there was not coeval of the guy so he was just silent and lazy. Then a teen girl with a zestful face appeared there offering some spicy food in her hand.
